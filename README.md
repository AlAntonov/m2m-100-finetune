**Scripts for finetuning m2m-100 models**

For tokenizing training data use the file `tok.py`.

For finetuning the m2m-100 on your data use `m2m_multiling_tune_epochs.py`.

For translating with the produced model use `translate-with-m2m.py`. This code has to adjusted to the specific languages that are being used in the finetuning.
